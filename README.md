# Mall Customer Segmentation

This project segments shopping mall customers using K-Means clustering to uncover patterns in spending behavior and income levels. The goal is to help the business tailor personalized marketing strategies for each customer group.

## Dataset
- CSV file: `Mall_Customers.csv` (includes demographics and spending behavior)

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Objectives
- Segment customers based on income and spending behavior
- Understand key differences across clusters
- Support targeted marketing and product strategies

## Key Insights
- Customers with **high income but low spending** represent untapped potential — ideal for premium engagement campaigns.
- The **high income & high spending** segment is the most valuable and should be prioritized with VIP services.
- **Low income but high spending** customers show strong brand interest — suitable for loyalty and discount-based strategies.
- Distinct clusters reveal opportunities for **cross-selling**, **personalization**, and **customer retention programs**.
